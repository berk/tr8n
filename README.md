# Tr8n Update

Dear all,

the repository has now been permanently moved to:

https://github.com/tr8n/tr8n

This repository is now deprecated and will be removed in the near future.


THE PROJECT IS NOW UNDER FULL TIME DEVELOPMENT!


If you would like to follow the project's progress, please follow the repository above.


Unfortunately, i will no longer be supporting the 2.3.x branch. If there are any volunteers who want to support it, let me know.

The new development will only support Rails 3.2.x and 4.0.x


# What has happened to Tr8n thus far?


* Tr8n has undergone a complete core redesign: it can now be integrated as a rails/engine gem into a host application (the old way) or it can run as a stand-alone service application.

* A fully functional PHP Client SDK is now available for integration with any PHP application and Tr8n Service.

* A sample Wordpress and Mediawiki plugins are available. The plugins demonstrate how blogs and wiki articles can be translated inline and the translations can be managed by tr8n service.

* Tr8n is now using a brand new powerful rules engine, based on LISP like symbolic expressions.

* Tr8n now supports over 300 languages with context rules and language cases.

* Tr8n UI has been completely rewritten - it is now simple, lightweight and sexy.

* Tons of new features have been added to the management and administration tools.



# Where can i see it in action?

Tr8nhub Sandbox Server is now up and running at:

http://sandbox.tr8nhub.com

The service is currently by invitation only. Please request an invitation and i will gladly add you in.


I am looking for volunteers who are not afraid of giving tr8n a try and integrate it in their applications.

I am also available to help the early adopters to integrate tr8n into their applications or setup a service integration.
