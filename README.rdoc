= Welcome to Tr8n Translation Engine

Tr8n Translation Engine is a Rails Engine Plugin/Gem that provides a framework for crowd-sourced translations of your Rails application. 
The power of the engine comes from its simple and friendly user interface that allows site users as well as professional translators to rapidly 
translate the site into hundreds of languages. 

The rules engine that powers Tr8n allows translators to indicate whether sentences depend on gender rules, number rules or other rules configured for each language. The language specific context and case rules can be registered and managed for any language in the advanced user interface. The engine 
provides a set of powerful administration tools that allow admins to configure any aspect of the engine; enabling and disabling its features 
and monitoring translation progress.

The Tr8n engine is based on a robust and flexible pluggable architecture where rule types and even the syntax of the "tr" tokens 
can be configured or extended for any application deployment.

Tr8n translation engine has been successfully deployed by the following companies:

Geni Inc, http://www.geni.com

Yammer Inc, http://www.yammer.com 

You can visit their web sites and see how it is being used. If your company is using Tr8n, please let me know and you will be added to the list.
